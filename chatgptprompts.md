What is a class in JavaScript

In JavaScript, a class is a blueprint for creating objects with shared properties and methods. Introduced in ECMAScript 6 (ES6), classes provide a more structured way to work with objects and inheritance, making the code easier to understand and maintain.

Key Concepts:
Class Declaration: A class is defined using the class keyword.

javascript
Copy code
class Person {
  constructor(name, age) {
    this.name = name;
    this.age = age;
  }
  
  // Method inside class
  greet() {
    console.log(`Hello, my name is ${this.name}`);
  }
}
In the example above:

Person is the name of the class.
The constructor method is a special method for creating and initializing objects of the class. It's automatically called when a new object is created.
greet() is a method of the class.
Creating Objects (Instances): You can create objects from a class using the new keyword.

javascript
Copy code
const person1 = new Person('Alice', 25);
person1.greet(); // Output: Hello, my name is Alice
Inheritance: Classes support inheritance, which means you can create a new class based on an existing one, inheriting its properties and methods.

javascript
Copy code
class Student extends Person {
  constructor(name, age, grade) {
    super(name, age); // Call the parent class constructor
    this.grade = grade;
  }

  study() {
    console.log(`${this.name} is studying.`);
  }
}

const student1 = new Student('Bob', 21, 'A');
student1.greet();  // Output: Hello, my name is Bob
student1.study();  // Output: Bob is studying.
In this case:

Student is a subclass of Person, meaning it inherits properties like name and age, as well as methods like greet().
super() is used to call the constructor of the parent class.
Static Methods: Static methods belong to the class itself rather than instances of the class.

javascript
Copy code
class MathHelper {
  static add(x, y) {
    return x + y;
  }
}

console.log(MathHelper.add(2, 3)); // Output: 5
The add() method can be called directly on the class, without creating an instance.

Summary:
Classes in JavaScript simplify object creation and inheritance.
They are syntactic sugar over the traditional prototype-based inheritance used in earlier versions of JavaScript.
Classes support inheritance, encapsulation, and have constructors to initialize new objects.
